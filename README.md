* **Fig. 1a**, **Extended Data Fig. 3b** (`Fig.1a_s3b_microarray_Thion_2018.R`): Heatmap visualization of the developmental alterations of gene expressions in microglia in a published microarray dataset ([Thion et al. 2018, PMID: 29275859](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29275859/))
    * **Fig. 1a**: Immune checkpoints and TGFβ pathway-related molecules 
    * **Extended Data Fig. 3b**: MGnD and homeostasis associated genes
    
* **Fig. 1b** (`Fig.1b_GSE127449_P9_P28_scRNAseq.R`): Dotplot visualization of gene expression at postnatal stages (P9 and P28) in a published scRNA-seq dataset ([He et al. 2018, PMID: 34982959](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34982959/); [GSE127449](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE127449))

* **Fig. 1h** (`Fig.1h_1month_heatmap_DEGs.R`): Heatmap visualization of DEGs (FDR < 0.05) of 1-month-old *Havcr2*<sup>cKO</sup> mice (n = 4 (3 males, 1 female)) compared to *Havcr2*<sup>flox/flox</sup> mice (n = 5 (4 males, 1 female)). Rows represent genes and columns are biological replicates. Gene expression is row-normalized across replicates. 

* **Fig. 1i** (`Fig.1i_1month_volcanoplot.R`): Volcano plot of differential gene expression analysis performed by DESeq2 comparing 1-month-old *Havcr2*<sup>cKO</sup> to *Havcr2*<sup>flox/flox</sup> mice

* **Fig. 1j-l** (`Fig.1j_1l_1month_signature_score.R`): Boxplot visualization of the the scores of MGnD (j), homeostasis (k), and KEGG phagosome (l) signatures in 1-month-old *Havcr2*<sup>cKO</sup> compared to *Havcr2*<sup>flox/flox</sup> mice. The Y-axis represents log2 transformed average TPM, and significance was calculated using the Student's two-tailed t-test.

### Figure 2

* **Fig. 2b** (`Fig.2b_1month_Tgfbr2_scatter_plot.R`): Scatter plot of genes based on expressional difference represented by log2-transformed fold changes in *Havcr2*<sup>cKO</sup> (X-axis) and *Tgfbr2*<sup>cKO</sup> (Y-axis) compared to control microglia

### Figure 3

* **Fig. 3g** (`Fig.3g_3month_overlap_DEGs.R`): Heatmap visualization of top DEGs shared by at least two of the following three comparisons (3-month-old mice)
    (1) control phagocytosing versus control non-phagocytosing microglia
    (2) *Havcr2*<sup>cKO</sup> phagocytosing versus control phagocytosing microglia
    (3) *Havcr2*<sup>cKO</sup> non-phagocytosing versus control non-phagocytosing microglia
* **Fig. 3k** (`Fig.3k_3month_nonphago_DEGs_pathway.R`):  Pathway analysis of DEGs in non-phagocytosing microglia from 3-month-old *Havcr2*<sup>cKO</sup> mice compared to control mice. Disease pathways (pathways under section 6.1-6.10 from https://www.kegg.jp/kegg/pathway.html) and ribosomal genes were excluded from the analysis.
